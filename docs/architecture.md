# Architecture Conventions

`k-parent-skill` keeps the repository architecture of `NomaDamas/k-skill` and changes the domain concept to 대한민국 부모 생활정보.

## Skill-first pattern

- Treat a root skill directory as the public unit of capability.
- Treat departments as the product taxonomy, not as nested install paths. Do not move skill folders under department folders.
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and procedural. Put deeper explanation in `docs/features/<skill-name>.md`.
- Put department strategy, shared schemas, and skill maps in `docs/departments/<department>.md`.
- Use `SKILL.md`-only placeholders for concept validation.
- Add implementation code only when repeated usage proves that deterministic parsing, normalization, or API access is needed.

## Progressive disclosure pattern

Parent skills should preserve the upstream `k-skill` context-budget pattern:

| Stage | Name | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Advertise | `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` and `description` should be enough for semantic routing. Descriptions are written for agent matching, not humans browsing a catalog. For k-parent skills write the description in Korean, include 2-3 concrete trigger utterances, and add a boundary sentence when a sibling skill overlaps. See `docs/adding-a-skill.md` and the cross-skill map in `docs/skill-routing.md`. |
| 2 | Load | The `SKILL.md` body should stay compact and procedural: when to use, what to ask, workflow, output fields, failure modes. When a deterministic package backs the skill, add a `## 데이터 소스` section naming the package, functions, and env vars. |
| 3 | Read resources | Long API field maps, policy manuals, PDF-derived tables, and crawler schemas should live in a `<skill>/references/*.md` file (e.g. `k-parent-meal-planner/references/allergen-codes.md`) and be read only when needed. |

This keeps many parent skills installable together without flooding an agent's initial context.

## Department taxonomy

K-Parent Skills uses these top-level departments:

| Department | Korean label | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `school` | 학교 | school notices, meals, kindergarten, after-school, documents, applications |
| `academy` | 학원 | hagwon apps/APIs, classes, homework, attendance, makeup lessons, billing |
| `play` | 놀이 | places to go, indoor/outdoor play, festivals, culture centers, events |
| `life` | 생활 | childcare, benefits, healthcare, public applications, family logistics |
| `trend` | 트렌드 | parenting trends, local buzz, seasonal topics, popular programs |
| `shopping` | 쇼핑 | supplies, books, toys, price comparison, inventory, optional affiliate recommendations, purchase planning |
| `nutrition` | 영양 | school meals, kindergarten meals, allergies, home meal planning |

Department membership is metadata and documentation. A skill may belong to one primary department and optional secondary departments, but the root folder name stays stable.

## Implementation promotion path

1. `SKILL.md` placeholder: instructions, examples, failure modes, and safety rules.
2. Feature doc: source surfaces, output format, and known limitations.
3. Script helper: small one-off deterministic task.
4. Package helper: reusable Node package under `packages/*`.
5. Proxy route: free/public API aggregation via `packages/k-skill-proxy`.

## Public data integration pattern

Many parent workflows depend on public data where a natural-language query is not enough. Prefer resolver-first pipelines:

1. Resolve user language into official identifiers: school code, education office code, district code, institution id, coordinates, or dataset id.
2. Query the official/public source with those identifiers.
3. Normalize records into parent decision fields.
4. Store provenance: official URL, source name, collection time, field confidence, and freshness.
5. Explain missing or stale data instead of silently substituting guesses.

Priority source families:

- NEIS: school resolver, academic schedule, timetable candidates, school meals, allergy and nutrition fields.
- Kindergarten and childcare disclosure: operating type, hours, after-school/extended care, cost, teacher/staff, safety, meal, vehicle, and application indicators.
- TourAPI and local government datasets: festivals, events, child-friendly places, travel and seasonal programs.
- Public reservation and lifelong education datasets: culture centers, libraries, civic programs, arts education, registration status.
- Government24 and Bokjiro: eligibility guidance, document checklists, official links, and reminder candidates.

Default source priority:

1. Official API or official disclosure.
2. Public data file download.
3. Map or local-search API for freshness and geocoding.
4. Limited scraping for public fields missing from official sources.
5. Community, blog, or review signals as secondary context only.

The assistant should avoid ranking schools or childcare institutions as leaderboards. Prefer practical comparison fields such as distance, hours, care options, class size, meal/safety data, cost, official notices, and deadlines.

## Normalization layer pattern

Parent-domain implementations may keep skills independent while sharing a central normalization layer for codes and profile context:

- `region_code_map`: education, tourism, public-service, legal-dong, and local-government code mapping.
- `institution`: schools, kindergartens, childcare centers, culture centers, libraries, and civic facilities.
- `content_item`: festivals, outings, classes, programs, and events.
- `application_service`: benefits, care programs, reservations, and public-service metadata.
- `parent_profile`, `child_profile`, and `consent_log`: minimal product profile and consent records.

Do not duplicate NEIS, TourAPI, public-reservation, and welfare code mapping logic inside every skill. Skills should call shared resolvers when the implementation is promoted beyond placeholder docs.

## Cache and crawler pattern

Use live calls only when the data is volatile or the user needs a current answer. For slow-moving datasets, prefer scheduled or local/server-side synchronization:

- Cache school, kindergarten, childcare, program, and policy reference data with refresh time.
- Keep raw source payloads separate from normalized records.
- Deduplicate by official id when available; otherwise use source URL, title, date, place, and text hash.
- Treat crawler output as fallible: expose blocked, stale, empty, and parse-error states.
- Keep scraping code in helpers or server jobs; do not encode brittle browser steps only in `SKILL.md`.
- Prefer official APIs before headless-browser scraping.

## Mobile agent product pattern

The product target is a server-deployed mobile-first parent agent for normal users, not only local developer skills:

1. Mobile surface: parent can open a URL/app, select a child, and ask agentic questions.
2. Server runtime: crawlers, OCR, schedule extraction, recommendation jobs, and connector tasks run server-side.
3. Source layer: school data, timetables, education office data, lifelong education, festivals, events, trend sources, and travel/place data are collected with provenance.
4. Personal layer: child schedule, family calendar, reminders, school documents, academy notices, and preferences are user-controlled.
5. Action layer: calendar writes, applications, reservations, messages, and purchases require explicit confirmation.
6. QA layer: gstack validates mobile flows, source freshness states, and deployed canaries.

## Document ingestion pattern

School, academy, and institution documents should follow an ingest-normalize-confirm flow:

1. Capture original: photo, PDF, app screenshot, message, or downloaded attachment.
2. Extract text: OCR or structured parser, keeping confidence and source page/region when available.
3. Normalize entities: date, time, place, child/grade target, cost, materials, deadline, application URL, contact, and issuer.
4. Store linkable records: keep original path, extracted text, normalized JSON, source date, and confirmation state together.
5. Propose actions: calendar events, reminders, checklist items, or application tasks.
6. Confirm before side effects: write to calendar, send messages, submit applications, or pay only after explicit user approval.

## Commerce and affiliate pattern

Shopping recommendations may monetize through Coupang Partners or other affiliate links, but this is not core product logic. Recommendations must preserve parent trust:

1. Start from a concrete parent need: school supply list, academy book, event material, nutrition item, toy, or household repeat purchase.
2. Normalize the need before recommending products: item name, quantity, deadline, required/optional status, age/grade fit, budget, delivery deadline, and source document.
3. Present non-affiliate decision information first: product type, constraints, price range, delivery estimate, alternatives, and whether offline/used purchase is reasonable.
4. Disclose affiliate status before showing affiliate links. Use clear wording that purchase through the link may generate commission.
5. Provide affiliate links only after the user asks to buy, compare purchase candidates, or requests product links.
6. Do not auto-purchase, add to cart, or steer around safety/age suitability for commission.
7. Keep commercial ranking explainable: relevance, deadline fit, price, reviews, delivery, and stock should be visible signals.

## Sensitive transaction boundary

Government services, care applications, reservations, payments, academy account actions, and child-data writes require a hard boundary:

1. The agent may collect public requirements, summarize procedures, prepare checklists, and create reminder/calendar candidates.
2. The agent may open or link to official pages for the parent.
3. The agent must not collect NPKI/certificate credentials, impersonate identity verification, submit government applications, reserve paid programs, cancel bookings, pay, or expose child personal data without explicit approval.
4. For certificate-login or identity-heavy services, default to pre-transaction guidance and handoff to the official site.

## gstack development loop

Use gstack as the development and commercialization quality loop once this repo grows beyond pure skill documents:

1. Product surface: build the smallest usable mobile web/app surface for one parent workflow.
2. Dogfood: use gstack browser QA to run the real parent flow end to end.
3. Design review: inspect screenshots for clarity, trust, source freshness, mobile usability, and parent decision load.
4. Benchmark: record load, data refresh, crawler, OCR/import, recommendation, and calendar latency baselines before larger changes.
5. Canary: after deploy, verify the live app has no blocking console errors and that key flows still work.
6. Ship discipline: keep skill docs, schemas, tests, and product screens aligned in each PR.

## Parent-domain output schema

Parent-facing skills should normalize information into practical decision fields:

- child age or grade
- region and travel distance
- date range and deadline
- target age or eligibility
- cost, materials, documents, and login requirements
- reservation/application status
- official source URL
- confirmation date
- next action for the parent
- original document path or capture source when the information came from OCR/PDF/app screenshots
- confidence and review-needed flag for OCR-derived fields
- commerce disclosure and affiliate link status when the next action is purchase-related
- source freshness and crawl provenance when the answer depends on collected data

## Safety and privacy

- Do not store child names, birth dates, school identifiers, contact information, or application credentials in the repository.
- Store OCR outputs and document metadata in user-controlled local storage by default; do not commit captured school or academy documents.
- Do not submit applications, make reservations, cancel, pay, or enter child-personal-data without explicit user approval.
- Do not hide affiliate relationships or present paid links as neutral recommendations.
- Separate confirmed official information from recommendations, guesses, reviews, or stale search snippets.
- Schedules, admissions, events, and applications are time-sensitive. Verify current sources before answering.

## Agent context surfaces

Future agents should use these files as the standing repository context:

- `AGENTS.md`: operational rules for coding agents
- `CLAUDE.md`: compact Claude Code context
- `docs/architecture.md`: architecture and promotion conventions
- `docs/adding-a-skill.md`: new skill workflow
- `docs/departments/README.md`: department taxonomy and skill map
- `docs/productization-gstack.md`: gstack-based development and commercialization plan
- `docs/roadmap.md`: concept and implementation priorities

When changing the architecture or conventions, update these surfaces together.
